  "content": "At a small convenience store along Orchard Road, Singapore, the air is cool and bright under fluorescent lights, 
  with neatly stocked shelves of snacks, drinks, and toiletries. A man in his late thirties, wearing a dark blue hoodie, jeans, 
  and sports shoes, strolls in casually, glancing briefly at the cashier in a red polo shirt who is serving another customer. 
  Moving to the chocolate aisle, he picks up a bar, checks the price, then discreetly slips two bars and an energy drink into 
  his hoodie pocket while pretending to stretch. A woman in a floral dress walks past, and he steps aside, feigning interest in 
  potato chips. Drifting to the refrigerated section, he opens a glass door, retrieves a canned cold brew coffee, and hides it 
  inside a paper bag with a few cheap snacks. Approaching the counter, he picks up a small packet of gum to appear like a paying
  customer, pays in cash, and leaves with a quiet “thank you.” The automatic door slides open to the busy Orchard Road night as
  he merges into the crowd, stolen goods concealed, while the overhead CCTV silently captures every move."
