A comprehensive law enforcement tool that combines advanced Natural Language Processing, artificial intelligence, and forensic analysis techniques to process witness interviews, detect contradictions, and generate video reconstruction prompts.

## Project Overview

UNRAVEL revolutionizes criminal investigation processes by providing law enforcement agencies with AI-powered tools for analyzing witness statements, detecting inconsistencies, and generating forensic reconstructions. The system addresses critical challenges in witness testimony evaluation by reducing human bias and improving investigation efficiency.

### Key Problems Addressed

- **Human Bias**: Investigators may unconsciously favor certain witnesses or overlook contradictions
- **Time Constraints**: Manual analysis of witness statements is resource-intensive
- **Inconsistency Detection**: Human reviewers may miss subtle discrepancies across testimonies
- **Cross-Verification**: Comparing multiple witness accounts manually is error-prone
- **Evidence Quality**: Limited capability for objective witness reliability assessment

### System Components

1. **Intelligent Interview Analysis System**: Processes individual witness statements for contradictions, sentiment analysis, and psychological indicators
2. **Multi-Witness Cross-Verification System**: Compares multiple testimonies to identify confirmed facts and conflicting information
3. **Forensic Text-to-Video System**: Generates crime scene reconstruction prompts compatible with DeeVid AI

## Features

### Core Analysis Capabilities
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts interview recordings to text using OpenAI Whisper models
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies inconsistencies within individual statements and across multiple witnesses
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluates emotional states using DistilBERT models
- **Psychological Profiling**: Analyzes witness reliability indicators using Empath categorization
- **Follow-up Question Generation**: Creates targeted interview questions using GPT models
- **Cross-Verification**: Compares witness accounts to establish fact reliability

### Technical Features
- Multi-format audio support (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AAC)
- Local and cloud-based processing options
- Automated fallback systems for model failures
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- JSON and PDF report generation

```

### Configuration Examples

**Multi-witness configuration file (witnesses.json):**
```json
{
  "case_info": {
    "case_id": "CASE_001",
    "incident_date": "2024-01-15",
    "incident_type": "robbery"
  },
  "witnesses": [
    {
      "witness_id": "witness_1",
      "transcript": "I saw the suspect run from the building around 3 PM",
      "name": "John Doe"
    },
    {
      "witness_id": "witness_2", 
      "transcript": "The person walked calmly at approximately 2:30 PM",
      "name": "Jane Smith"
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Workflows

### Single Witness Analysis
1. **Input Processing**: Load audio file or text transcript
2. **Transcription**: Convert audio to text (if applicable)
3. **Analysis Pipeline**: 
   - Sentiment analysis for emotional assessment
   - Contradiction detection within statement
   - Psychological profiling for reliability indicators
4. **Output Generation**: JSON report with confidence scores and follow-up questions

### Multi-Witness Cross-Verification
1. **Individual Processing**: Analyze each witness statement separately
2. **Fact Extraction**: Extract structured information from each testimony
3. **Cross-Verification**: Compare facts across witnesses for consistency
4. **Reliability Assessment**: Rank witnesses by statement consistency
5. **Consolidated Report**: Generate summary with confirmed facts and conflicts

### Video Reconstruction Pipeline
1. **Feature Extraction**: Process witness statements for visual elements
2. **Scene Organization**: Structure elements by timeline and location
3. **Prompt Generation**: Create DeeVid AI compatible descriptions
4. **Dual Scenarios**: Generate factual and alternative interpretation prompts

## Output Files

### Generated Reports
- **Individual witness analyses**: `witness_1.json`, `witness_2.json`
- **Cross-verification summary**: `witness_summary.json`
- **Video prompts**: `known_scenario_prompt.txt`, `alternative_scenario_prompt.txt`
- **Processing logs**: Stored in `logs/` directory for debugging

### Report Structure
```json
{
  "witness_info": {
    "witness_id": "witness_1",
    "analysis_timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "confidence_score": 0.75
  },
  "analysis_results": {
    "contradictions_found": 1,
    "emotional_state": "anxious (82% confidence)",
    "reliability_indicators": ["consistent_timeline", "detailed_observations"]
  },
  "follow_up_questions": [
    "Can you describe the lighting conditions more specifically?",
    "How certain are you about the time of the incident?"
  ]
}
```

## Error Handling and Limitations

### Robust Failure Management
- **API Failures**: Automatic fallback to local Whisper models when OpenAI API is unavailable
- **Model Loading**: Graceful degradation with alternative models if primary models fail
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive checking of file formats and content before processing
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup for large files and batch processing

### System Limitations
- **Language Support**: Currently optimized for English-language interviews
- **Audio Quality**: Transcription accuracy depends on recording quality (background noise affects performance)
- **Processing Time**: Complex analyses may require several minutes for lengthy interviews
- **Model Accuracy**: AI-generated analysis requires human oversight for critical decisions

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Installation Problems:**
- "No module named 'whisper'": Run `pip install openai-whisper`
- "FFmpeg not found": Verify FFmpeg installation and PATH configuration
- "spaCy model missing": Execute `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`

**Performance Optimization:**
- Use smaller Whisper models for faster processing: `--model-size small`
- Enable local-only processing to avoid API delays
- Process shorter audio segments for memory-constrained environments

## Integration and Deployment

### Input Format Support
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WMA, AAC formats
- **Text**: Plain text, JSON structured data, batch configuration files
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 text encoding with automatic detection

### Output Integration
- **JSON APIs**: Structured data for system integration
- **PDF Reports**: Formatted documents for legal proceedings
- **DeeVid AI Compatibility**: Direct integration with video generation platforms
- **Batch Processing**: Folder-based analysis for multiple cases

### Deployment Considerations
- **Resource Requirements**: Minimum 8GB RAM for local model processing
- **Network Dependencies**: Internet required for OpenAI API features
- **Security**: Local processing option available for sensitive cases
- **Scalability**: Supports batch processing for multiple interviews

## Quality Assurance

### Accuracy Measures
- **Transcription**: Achieves 90-95% accuracy on clear audio recordings
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies approximately 80-85% of genuine inconsistencies
- **Cross-Verification**: 85-90% agreement with expert human analysis on test cases

### Validation Methods
- Tested with sample law enforcement interview scenarios
- Compared results against manual analysis by forensic experts
- Validated contradiction detection using known inconsistent statement pairs
- Performance benchmarked on various audio quality conditions

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Evidence Standards
- **Human Oversight**: AI analysis supplements but does not replace human judgment
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of analysis steps for court documentation
- **Chain of Custody**: Secure file handling with integrity verification
- **Bias Mitigation**: Regular testing for potential algorithmic bias

### Privacy and Security
- **Data Protection**: Local processing option avoids external API data sharing
- **Anonymization**: Witness identifiers can be removed from analysis outputs
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted file handling for sensitive case materials
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for multi-user deployments

## Support and Documentation
