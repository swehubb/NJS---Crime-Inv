Anyway, I passed by the corner store when I heard shouting. At first, I thought it was just a couple arguing, but then I saw a guy in a black hoodie run out holding a bag. He looked tall—well, medium height actually—and maybe heavyset, though come to think of it he seemed kind of skinny when he turned the corner. I couldn’t see his face because of the hood, but I remember his beard pretty clearly. He definitely had no facial hair, though. The bag he carried was red, or maybe dark blue—it was hard to tell under the lights. I was standing right outside the store, though now that I think about it, I might’ve been across the street waiting for the bus. Either way, I didn’t stick around long because I didn’t want to get involved."
